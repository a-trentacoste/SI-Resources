# SI-Resources
This depository currently contains materials used at an introducotory workshop to stable isotope analysis in R held in at CAU Kiel in May 2023. <p>
Files include annotated R scripts and PDFs of the presentation slides including a detailed breakdown of the scripts. Data manipulation and visualisation is undertaken via the <a href = "https://www.tidyverse.org/"> Tidyverse  </a> family of packages (e.g. ggplot2, etc.). <p>
In the future it is intended to continue to expand these resources.
<b> Please cite the resources if you use them. </b>


## Content
#### R for isotope analysis -- Kiel, 12 May 2023 -- Angela Trentacoste
1_Getting started
> R basics, organising folders, installing packages, importing/exporting data, tidyverse and data wrangling, coding without tears

2_Plotting
>Intro to ggplot, plotting isotopic data â€“ scatter plots, confidence ellipses, intra-tooth C/O plots, organising data for plotting, principles of good data viz

3_Bone collagen quality checks
> A workflow for interrogating bone collagen SI data, removing poor quality samples 

4_Stats and data manipulation
> Organising and joining data, how to calculate summary statistics, a workflow for choosing statistical tests, testing and effect size

Troubleshooting, data potluck, specialised packages, further resources
> Final free time to work out any issues, ensure you can get your own data working in R, and/or getting started in rKIN (isotopic niche space) and seasonality modelling
